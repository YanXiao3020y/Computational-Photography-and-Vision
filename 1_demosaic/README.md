**Overview**

This assignment involves using Python\'s NumPy and Matplotlib libraries
in Jupyter Notebooks to perform basic array operations and image
processing tasks. It includes exercises on manipulating arrays, such as
slicing, sorting, and reshaping, as well as working with images by
loading, converting to grayscale, and performing pixel-wise operations.
The assignment also covers creating average images from a set of images
and visualizing data through plots and histograms, providing a
foundation for more advanced computational tasks.
