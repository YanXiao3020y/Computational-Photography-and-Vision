**Overview**

This assignment focuses on creating image mosaics by aligning and
blending multiple photographs into a panoramic mosaic. The process
involves selecting corresponding points between overlapping images,
computing homography transformations, and warping the images to align
them in a common coordinate system. The task includes manually selecting
at least four corresponding points in overlapping regions, estimating
transformation matrices, and applying these transformations to warp the
images. The final step requires blending the warped images smoothly to
eliminate artifacts, using techniques like Gaussian blur or distance
transform. The assignment concludes with visualizing the results,
including the warped images, alpha maps, and the final mosaic.
