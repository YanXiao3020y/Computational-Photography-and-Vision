**Overview**

In this assignment, you will implement image processing techniques to
create and stitch together textures. Key tasks include finding the
shortest path through a cost matrix to minimize vertical seam costs,
combining two images with minimal visible seams, and synthesizing a new
texture by stitching tiles together. The assignment involves developing
functions to handle these tasks and demonstrating their effectiveness on
sample textures by experimenting with different parameters to achieve
visually appealing results.
