**Overview**

The goal of these five assignments is to develop fundamental image
processing and computer vision techniques using Python. They cover a
range of tasks including basic array operations, image manipulation, and
visualization with NumPy and Matplotlib. Key assignments involve
creating image mosaics by aligning and blending multiple photos into a
panoramic view, stitching textures together by minimizing seam
visibility, and implementing object detection using gradient-based
features and HOG descriptors. Additionally, one assignment focuses on
advanced techniques such as face morphing and swapping using piecewise
affine warping, requiring affine transformation computations and image
blending to transition between or replace faces.
